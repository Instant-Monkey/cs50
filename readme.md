Repo for my solutions to the problem sets of the cs50 course.

This is CS50x, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. As of Fall 2016, the on-campus version of CS50x, CS50, was Harvard's largest course.

Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project are eligible for a certificate. This is a self-paced course–you may take CS50x on your own schedule.

### PSET1 (in C):

- Implement a program that prints out a simple greeting to the user
- Implement a program that prints out a double half-pyramid of a specified height
- Implement a program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhn’s algorithm.

### PSET2 (in C):

- Implement a program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher
- Implement a program that encrypts messages using Vigenère’s cipher
- Implement a program that cracks passwords by brute force

### PSET3 (in C):

- Implement a search number program in O(log n) and a sort numbers program in O(n2).
- Implement the Game of Fifteen

### PSET4 (in C):

- Implement a program that reveals a hidden message in a BMP file
- Implement a program that resizes BMPs
- Implement a program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image

### PSET5 (in C):

- Implement a program that spell-checks words in a file
